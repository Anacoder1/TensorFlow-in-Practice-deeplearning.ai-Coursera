## Coding augmentation with ImageDataGenerator

train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale = 1./255)

train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale = 1./255,
    rotation_range = 40,	
    width_shift_range = 0.2,
    height_shift_range = 0.2,
    shear_range = 0.2,
    zoom_range = 0.2,
    horizontal_flip = True,
    fill_mode = 'nearest'
)

rotation_range = range from 0-180 degrees with which to
                 randomly rotate images.

Shifting moves the image around inside its frame.

Many pictures have the subjects centered, so if we train
based on those kind of images, we might overfit
for that scenario.

These parameters specify as a proportion of the image size,
how much we should randomly move the subject around.

e.g. offset the image 20% vertically and horizontally, as in the
example above


Shearing = moving images by skewing along x-, y- or z- axes
           to end up with similar orientations of subjects in images
           with those of an unseen image.

shear_range will shear the image by random amounts up to the
specified portion in the image.

e.g. shifting up to 20% of the image, as in the example above


zoom_range = helps create new images by zooming in on old ones

0.2 is a relative portion of the image you will zoom in on.

e.g. the zooms will be a random amount up to 20% of the size of the image,
     as in the example above.


horizontal_flip = flips images horizontally

e.g. an image with a woman with her left hand raised,
     will produce an image an image with the subject's left hand raised,
     instead of right hand


fill_mode = fills in any pixels that might have been
            lost by the operations 

fill_mode = 'nearest' (uses neighbors of that pixels to try and keep uniformity)
